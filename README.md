distinguish between cats and dogs

The purpose of this repository is to explore different machine learning models on their ability to distinuish between the different pictures of cats and dogs. This repository explores this problem through sci-kit learn. 

The published write-up is available on medium: https://lee322.medium.com/machine-learning-classifier-dogs-v-cats-f1c283ffbfe0

The training datasets were too large to publish in full so they were segemented into different parts. This is problematic becuase the code relies on a composite dataset. So for your convenience, the datasets are available in their .zip form here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dC3ogGXpXZpkeM5Ol36Bxh-88KmmrmJO?usp=sharing.

Please reach out for any questions about debugging or questions/comments/feedback.
